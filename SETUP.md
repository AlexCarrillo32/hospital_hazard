# Setup Guide: Pushing to GitHub

Since I don't have permissions to create a GitHub repository directly, please
follow these steps to create the repository and push the code:

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/new)
2. Create a new repository with these settings:
   - **Repository name**: `waste-compliance-agent`
   - **Description**:
     `AI-powered waste compliance and logistics platform for hazardous waste management`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have
     these)

## Step 2: Push to GitHub

After creating the repository, run these commands from the project directory:

```bash
cd /Users/alex.carrillo/waste-compliance-agent

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/waste-compliance-agent.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

## Step 3: Verify

Visit your repository on GitHub to verify all files were pushed correctly.

## Next Steps

After pushing to GitHub, you can:

1. **Set up CI/CD**: Add GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
2. **Configure branch protection**: Require tests to pass before merging
3. **Add collaborators**: Invite team members to contribute
4. **Create issues**: Track feature development and bugs

## Project Status

✅ All files committed and ready to push ✅ Tests passing (1/1) ✅ Linting
